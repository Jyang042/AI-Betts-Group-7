# BettsAI - CS 3793 Artificial Intelligence

Code repository for an Artificial Intelligence Deep Learning Model on Brain Tumor Diagnosis and Prediction

## Description

CS 3793 Artificial Intelligence

Improving the accuracy of brain tumor detection models can aid doctors in early
diagnosis of complex conditions, allowing more effective treatment plans and greater monitoring
of disease progression, leading to better patient outcomes and higher patient survival rates. Early
detection can minimize healthcare costs related to late stage disease treatment. Enhancing the
accuracy of detection models is essential in critical situations, where precision in detection
cannot be compromised. We will explore and test several methods for image based cancer
diagnosis through the use of artificial intelligence.
